This duty to consult is based on the recognition that worker input and participation improves decision-making about health and safety matters and assists in reducing work-related injuries and disease. The broad is reasonably practicable, with contractors and sub-contractors and their employees, on-hire workers, outworkers, apprentices, trainees, work experience students, volunteers and other people who are working for the PCBU and who are, or are likely to be, directly affected by a health and safety matter. Workers are entitled to take part in consultations and to be represented in consultations by a health and safety representative who has been elected to represent their work group. \nConsulting, cooperating and coordinating activities with other duty holders \nWHS Act section 46 \nDuty to consult with other duty holders \nThe WHS Act requires that a PCBU consult, cooperate and coordinate activities with all other persons who have a work health and safety duty in relation to the same matter, so far as is reasonably practicable.  There is often more than one business or undertaking involved when asbestos-related work is being carried out, who may each have responsibility for the same health and safety matters, either because they are involved in the same activities or share the same workplace. In these situations, each duty holder should exchange information to find out who is doing what and work together in a cooperative and coordinated way so risks are eliminated or minimised so far as is reasonably practicable.  Further guidance on consultation is available in the Code of Practice: Work health and safety consultation, cooperation and coordination. "
