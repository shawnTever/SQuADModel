Duty to consult workers. A PCBU must consult, so far as is reasonably practicable, with workers who carry out work for the business or undertaking and who are (or are likely to be) directly affected by a health and safety matter. This duty to consult is based on the recognition that worker input and participation improves decision-making about health and safety matters and assists in reducing work-related injuries and disease.

Workers are entitled to take part in consultations and to be represented in consultations by a health and safety representative who has been elected to represent their work group. Consulting, cooperating and coordinating activities with other duty holders. WHS Act section 46. Duty to consult with other duty holders. The WHS Act requires that a PCBU consult, cooperate and coordinate activities with all other persons who have a work health and safety duty in relation to the same matter, so far as is reasonably practicable.  There is often more than one business or undertaking involved when asbestos-related work is being carried out, who may each have responsibility for the same health and safety matters, either because they are involved in the same activities or share the same workplace. In these situations, each duty holder should exchange information to find out who is doing what and work together in a cooperative and coordinated way so risks are eliminated or minimised so far as is reasonably practicable.  Further guidance on consultation is available in the Code of Practice: Work health and safety consultation, cooperation and coordination. "

Table 1 Licence requirements for asbestos removal work. Type of licence What asbestos can be removed? Class A Can remove any amount or quantity of asbestos or ACM, including:  any amount of friable asbestos or ACM  any amount of ACD   any amount of non-friable asbestos or ACM. Class B Can remove:  any amount of non-friable asbestos or ACM   any amount of ACD associated with the removal of non-friable asbestos or ACM. No licence required None.

The need for health monitoring for workers at risk of exposure to asbestos should be determined on the basis of:  the potential for exposure the frequency of potential exposure, and the duration of the work being undertaken. If a worker is carrying out licensed asbestos removal work, the health monitoring must be conducted prior to the worker commencing the work. Health monitoring should also be provided to the worker at regular intervals (at least once every two years) after the worker commences asbestos-related work where there is a risk of exposure to asbestos. Who can carry out health monitoring? The PCBU must ensure health monitoring is carried out by or under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner with experience in health monitoring. Prior to deciding who the registered medical practitioner will be, the PCBU must consult the worker. Who pays for health monitoring? The PCBU must pay all expenses relating to health monitoring. If two or more PCBUs have a duty to provide health monitoring to a worker, they may choose one PCBU to organise health monitoring (known as the PCBU who commissions the health monitoring). The costs must be shared equally between each PCBU unless they agree otherwise. What information must be provided to the registered medical practitioner? The PCBU who commissions health monitoring must provide the following information to the registered medical practitioner:  their name and address the name and date of birth of the worker a description of the work the worker is, or will be, carrying out that has triggered the requirement for health monitoring, and whether the worker has started the work or, if the worker has commenced, carrying out the work, how long this has been for.

Duty to train workers about asbestos. WHS Regulation section 445A. Duty to train workers about working with asbestos. If, as a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU), you do not hold a Class A or Class B asbestos removal licence, you may only carry out work involving asbestos if it is in the course of minor or routine maintenance work, or other minor work. Work involves asbestos if the work involves manufacturing, supplying, transporting, storing, removing, using, installing, handling, treating, disposing of or disturbing asbestos or ACM (WHS Regulations section 419). You must not remove, or direct or allow a worker to remove, friable asbestos materials if you do not have a Class A asbestos licence.  You must ensure workers carrying out work involving asbestos, including a self-employed person conducting a business or undertaking, are trained in the VET course Asbestos Awareness. Workers in certain prescribed occupations must also have completed the VET course Working safely with asbestos. For example, if you are a plumber, this allows you to disturb small amounts of non-friable asbestos if you come across it during renovations, refurbishments, or service and maintenance work. However, you must still use safe working methods to ensure the work is not creating a risk to the health and safety of people at the workplace.  If you disturb asbestos in the course of your work you must comply with the duties outlined in Chapter 4 of this Code and also with some of the duties in Chapter 3 of this Code. These duties are summarised below:  obtain a copy of the asbestos register for a workplace unless the work is being carried out at residential premises (refer to section 3.4)  identify hazards at the workplace (refer to section 4.1)  ensure signs and barricades are erected to indicate and delineate the asbestos work area (refer to sections 3.7 and 4.2)  use the wet method to remove asbestos where reasonably practicable (refer to section 4.3)  ensure the correct tools, equipment (and PPE are used (refer to )  ensure decontamination facilities are available (refer to sections 3.8 and 4.6)  contain and label asbestos waste and dispose of it as soon as reasonably practicable at a site licensed to accept asbestos waste (refer to sections 3.9 and 4.8), and ensure that PPE and clothing used in asbestos removal work and contaminated with asbestos is handled in accordance with the WHS Regulations (refer to sections 3.9, 4.5 and 4.6).  Although it is not mandatory for you to prepare an asbestos removal control plan if you disturb asbestos in the course of minor or routine maintenance work, or other minor work, it may be beneficial to do so to ensure the work is being carried out safely. Refer to section 3.5 for further information on an asbestos removal control plan. It is also not mandatory to conduct air monitoring but an independent licensed asbestos assessor can carry it out in these situations. Refer to section 3.11 for further information on air monitoring."

Additional duties apply to a number of other duty holders including the person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) who commissioned the asbestos removal work, and the person with management and control of the workplace. These duties include:  informing various persons about the asbestos removal and providing them with appropriate information ensuring clearance inspections are conducted and clearance certificates are issued, and ensuring air monitoring is conducted, where appropriate.
